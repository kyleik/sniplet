# Sniplet
A platform where you can record, sample and share 11-second audio clips called Sniplets.

## Features

The Queue is the main feed of the application. It displays a stream of Sniplets from accounts that you follow. As you scroll, the Sniplets automatically play for you. Users can loop another user's Sniplet (re-post another user's content on the feed), as well as reply to another user by creating their own Sniplet.

The Explore page allows you to discover other users and view the most trending Sniplets on the platform. In the 'On Repeat' tab, you'll find Sniplets with the highest amount of loops on the platform. The Create page is where you go to record new audio and share it with the world.

The Notifications page and Profile page show all of the activity surrounding your page. Every user can have their own Tag, an introductory audio that plays at the top of the profile page.
